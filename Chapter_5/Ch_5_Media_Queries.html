    <p>A computer is a device that can perform computations and make
        logical decisions phenomenally faster than human beings can.
        Many of today's personal computers can perform billions of
        calculations in one second&mdash;more than a human can perform
        in a lifetime. Supercomputers are already performing thousands
        of trillions (quadrillions) of instructions per second! To put
        that in perspective, a quadrillion-instruction-per-second
        computer can perform in one second more than 100,000
        calculations for every person on the planet! And&mdash;these
        "upper limits" are growing quickly!</p>

    <p>Computers process data under the control of sets of
        instructions called computer programs. These programs guide
        the computer through orderly sets of actions specified by
        people called computer programmers. The programs that run on a
        computer are referred to as software. In this book, you'll
        learn today's key programming methodology that's enhancing
        programmer prdouctivity, thereby reducing software-development
        cost&mdash;object oriented programming.</p>

    <p>A computer consists of various devices referred to as hardware
        (e.g. the keyboard, screen, mouse, hard disks, memory, DVDs
        and processing units). Computing coasts are dripping
        dramatically, owing to rapid developments in hardware and
        software technologies. Computers that might have filled large
        rooms and cost millions of dollars decards ago are now
        inscribed on silicon chips smaller than a fingernail, costing
        perhaps a few dollars each. Ironically, silicon is one of the
        most abundant materials&mdash;it's an ingredient in common
        sand. Silicon-chip technology has made computing so economical
        that more than a billion general-purpose computers are in use
        worldwide, and this is expected to double in the next few
        years.</p>

    <p>Computer chips (microprocessors) control countless devices.
        These embedded systems include anti-lock brakes in cars,
        navigation systems, smart hom appliances, home security
        systems, cell phones and smartphones, robots, intelligent
        traffic intersections, collision avoidance systems, video games
        controllers and more. The cast majority of the microprocessors
        produced each year are embedded indevices other than general-
        purpose computers.</p>
