<!--Create a simple search form using a search input element
in which the user can enter a search query. Using the Firefox web browser, test the form by
entering January and submitting the form. Then enter a J in the input element to see previous entries
that started with J - January should be displayed below the input element. Enter June and submit
the form again. Now enter a J in the input element to see previous entries that started with J -
January and June should be displayed below the input element. Try this with your own search queries
as well.-->
