10.10 Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A company pays its salespeople
on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for
that week. For example, a salesperson who grosses $5000 in sales in a week receives $200 plus 9%
of $5000, or a total of $650. Write a script (using an array of counters) that obtains the gross
sales for each employee through an HTML5 form and determines how many of the salespeople
earned salaries in each of the following ranges(assume that each salesperson's salary is truncated to
an integer amount):
    a. 200-299
    b. 300-399
    c. 400-499
    d. 500-599
    e. 600-699
    f. 700-799
    g. 800-899
    h. 900-999
    j. 1000 and over

1. The array is 9 elements long
2. form takes in employee total sales for the week
3. total pay = 200 + (sales * 0.09)
