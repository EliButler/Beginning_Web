<!--Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles. One driver has
kept track of several tankfuls of gasoline by recording the number of miles driven and
the number of gallons used for each tankful. The script should calculate and output
HTML5 tet that displays the number of miles per gallon obtained for each tankful and
prints the combined number of miles per gallon obtained for all tankfuls up to this point.
Use prompt dialogs to obtain the data from the user.-->
